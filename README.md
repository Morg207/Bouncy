# Bouncy
This is a 2D side scrolling platformer made with Python, Pygame and OpenGL and GLSL. It was mostly made to challenge myself at programming something with a tile map, something I'd never done before.

# 🐇 Bouncy: A Side-Scrolling Platformer (Python + Pygame + OpenGL)

**Bouncy** is a side-scrolling 2D platformer written in **Python**, using **Pygame** for input, window management, and audio, and **PyOpenGL** for hardware-accelerated rendering.

The goal is simple: collect all the bunnies while avoiding the snakes!
